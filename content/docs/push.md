In Cloud Foundry, deploying an app is achieved via a `cf push`. There is nothing special about the app you will be deploying. It is just a simple go application written for training purposes.

* Download the app here: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.artifacts.rscale.io/first-push-app.zip. 

* Unzip the file and go to the `training-app` directory in your terminal window.
 
* Now push the application (you need to be in the `training-app` directory):

  ```sh
  cf push first-push -b go_buildpack -m 64M --random-route
  ```

  > Note: You can use `cf push --help` to see the details of the `push` command.

Let's dissect the `push` command:

* `first-push` is the name of the application in Cloud Foundry. It should be a descriptive name for use by humans, and can be whatever you want.
* `-b go_buildpack` tells Cloud Foundry to use the Go Buildpack to stage the application. You could leave this off and let Cloud Foundry figure it out, but specifying via `-b` is slightly faster.
* `-m 64M` tells Cloud Foundry to allocate 64MB of memory to the container running the application.
* `--random-route` is used to ensure you don't have route conflicts with the other Cloud Foundry users. This should only be used for training purposes.

#### Checking your work

If everything is successful, you should see output for your running application:

```

```

The application has a user interface that shows some details about the application. You can copy the url of your application labeled as a `route` above and open it in a browser.

### Wait, what just happened?

In short, you deployed an app using a single command. It would have looked the same regardless of the language in which the app was written. The CLI on your machine uploaded the app bits to Cloud Foundry and also provided some information about what should happen.

Cloud Foundry took your app bits and used a [buildpack](https://buildpacks.io) to create an image with your app plus any necessary runtime dependencies. The resulting image was then used to run your application in a container. Once your app was running, Cloud Foundry began to automatically route traffic to it (hence your ability to access it in a browser).

> Cloud Foundry has been running apps in containers since long before Kubernetes or Docker existed. Depending on the Cloud Foundry instance you are using, your app may now be running in Kubernetes. Cloud Foundry will have handled all of the container image creation as well as Kubernetes complexity and configuration for you.

*And what didn't happen?*

You didn't build an image with a tool like Docker (though Cloud Foundry supports Docker, too). You didn't install any runtimes or manipulate any file systems. You didn't manually provision any resources like compute and storage. You didn't create and deploy a load balancer or reserve any ports. You didn't update routing tables or do any health checks. You just typed `cf push`. Pretty cool, right?

Now that we have an app running, let's provision a database for it to use.
